   abstract = {The paper proposes simulation algorithms for tensor representations of qualitative models based on stochastic automata. We show that storing the transition probabilities of the automaton in tensor formats will help to break the curse of dimensionality, i.e. to overcome the storage complexity problem of the automaton that occurs due to the exponential growth in the quantity of automata transitions when the number of input, state and output signals of the underlying discrete-time system rises. In addition, we present the application of a modern tensor optimization method for the completion of qualitative models identified by data-driven black-box approaches and thus suffering from the problem of unobserved sets of training data.},

@article{Cao2019,
   abstract = {Gaining in-depth and systematical knowledge of qualitative simulation technology and the related change rules is of great significance to controlling group unsafe behaviors of coal miners. In this study, the group safety behavior model of coal miners was established based on self-organized and hetero-organized behaviors. Using the qualitative simulation technology and the software platform of group safety behaviors based on the QSIM’s (Qualitative Simulation) filtering optimized by GA-BP (Genetic Algorithm – Back Propagation Neural Network Algorithm), group safety behaviors of coal miners are qualitatively simulated comprehensively and systematically. By comparing and analyzing the simulation results using 15 different schemes, the evolutional rules of group safety behaviors are concluded. Results show that, under any group initial states, if the group is disturbed by a number of external environmental factors and no control strategies are taken, the level of group safety behavior deteriorates. In addition, the management and control strategies should be implemented in a targeted manner when the level of group safety behavior drops. Finally, the research results are applied for guiding the safety management of a coal mine enterprise, which can reduce the incidence of unsafe behaviors. Accordingly, it can be concluded that desirable results can be achieved after the adoption of reasonable control strategies. Additionally, the proposed qualitative simulation technology based on the optimized QSIM algorithm not only improves the simulation efficiency and reliability of group safety behaviors, but also can provide references for relevant research and applications in the field.},
